# Multilayer Perceptron Network
Example of two simple multilayer perceptron networks written in MATLAB.
The purpose of the task was to create a **multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network** for **[classification](#classification-of-points) and approximation**.

## Classification of points
For this task the goal was to create and train a **multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network** capable of classifying points into **five groups** based on **three parameters *(x, y, z)***. The challenge was to find the **optimal network structure** (the smallest number of neurons in the hidden layer) that would allow the network to correctly classify as many points as possible, with a maximum of **two misclassified points**.
